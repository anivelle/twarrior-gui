# twarrior-gui
This is a GTK-based GUI for Task and Timewarrior. I recently began using these programs and they've been super neat, 
but I want to be able to view manage my tasks outside of the command line. I originally tried using the widget 
system in AwesomeWM, but I cannot wrap my head around it for some reason. Might give it another go in the future. 
With GTK, though, this program is more portable. As with my [ray tracer][ray-tracer] project, this repository will 
really serve me for everything as I learn GTK from the basics (I've only ever used Qt for GUIs).
# Current Progress
* I can run an external program and receive its output from stdout at the press of a button! That's about it 
# Goals
## Taskwarrior
* List of tasks
  * List items show description, due date, top tag, and urgency
  * Tasks can be added from list
  * Sort by due date, urgency, description, tags, etc
  * Filter tasks by context and/or tags 
* Task addition and modification
  * All available fields should be modifiable
  * Maybe hide some less-used fields under an "Advanced" tag
* Calendar/deadline view
## Timewarrior 
* Likely a lot simpler 
* List of tags
  * Show currently running (if any) at the top
  * Tag search
  * List items allow for start/stop of tag
  * Track previous time spent on tag 
* Day/week/month summary
  * Could start as just text-based but have a calendar view later
  * Allow tagging/untagging time sections, modifying start/end, deleting sections
